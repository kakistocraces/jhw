Here I am declaring dictionary lists to store the total votes and the percentages. Each candidate is the key for the dict file. The two dictionary lists are \texttt{totals} and \texttt{percentages} which will contain the total votes and the percentage of votes received for each candidate. 

\begin{verbatim}
totals = {}
percentages = {}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}



\end{verbatim}


For the four candidates Khan, O'Tooley, Li, and Correy, I am setting their total votes to 0. By setting the totals to 0, I am also declaring the variables. If you try to run the line \texttt{\texttt{totals["Khan"] = totals["Khan"] + 1}} you will get an error, unless the key has been initiated. 

\begin{verbatim}
totals["Khan"] = 0
totals["O'Tooley"] = 0
totals["Li"] = 0
totals["Correy"] = 0
total_vote = 0

\end{verbatim}

The following code opens election data csv file. Then each row is inputed into \texttt{csv\_reader} as an array of lists. Each list will contain a list of values that were separated by a comma. 

\begin{verbatim}
csvpath = os.path.join("Resources", "election_data.csv")  

with open(csvpath) as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter = ",")
    print(csv_reader)
    csv_header = next(csv_reader)
    print(csv_reader[2])

    for row in csv_reader:
	total_vote = total_vote + 1
	candidate = row[2]
	totals[candidate] += 1

    for candidate in totals:
	percentages[candidate] = totals[candidate] / total_vote * 100

    for candidate in totals:
	print(candidate, " Total = ", totals[candidate], " Percentage = ", percentages[candidate], "%")

print("Winner = ", max(totals, key=totals.get))
\end{verbatim}
